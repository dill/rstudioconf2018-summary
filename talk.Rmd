# RStudio::conf

- San Diego, CA. 2-3 Feb
- *Not* an academic conference
  - Fancy hotel
  - Fancy snacks & food
  - Lots of free stuff
  - Rooftop parties
  - (Do we really *need* any of that?)

# People *really* like hexagonal stickers

![hex stickers](images/hex.png)

---

# Central themes

- "tidyverse"
  - package ecosystem (more explanation in a moment)
- TensorFlow
  - fancy numerical optimisation
- `shiny`
  - make wee GUIs for yr code
- community building for open source projects

# okay, but what is "tidyverse"

.pull-left[
![opinionated](images/opinionated.png)

<small><a href="https://www.tidyverse.org">tidyverse.org</a></small>
]

.pull-right[
- Each variable is in a column
- Each observation is a row
- Each value is a cell

# Visual inference

- can we determine p-values from asking humans which plots are different?
- Lineup protocol: "compare the data plot with null plots of samples where there really is nothing going on"
- Rorschach protocol: "plot a lot of null samples, to get a sense for what might be seen when there is nothing"
- null samples by permutation or simulation
- (not new! Neyman, Scott and Shane, 1953)

# TensorFlow


.pull-left[
- high-performance library for numerical optimisation
  - "flow" comes from making a graph of the computation
- includes Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via automatic (algorithmic) differentiation
- lots of hype about "deep learning" **yawn**

# What is cool about TensorFlow?

- AD!
- Compile to binary (no R needed, incl. for `shiny` apps, [`tfdeploy`](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/tfdeploy/articles/introduction.html))
- Don't have to have full model in memory
- powers [`greta`](https://greta-dev.github.io/greta/)

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(greta)

x <- iris$Petal.Length
y <- iris$Sepal.Length

int = normal(0, 5)
coef = normal(0, 3)
sd = lognormal(0, 3)

mean <- int + coef * x
distribution(y) = normal(mean, sd)

m <- model(int, coef, sd)
```

# Spatial data with `sf` (Pedesma)

- `sp` is a *pain*
- `sf` ("simple features") is the next gen of `sp`
- simple features are:
  - points
  - lines
  - polygons

# Teaching with R (Kaplan)

- Use `learnr` + [`checkr`](https://github.com/dtkaplan/checkr) + ...
- Make interactive assignments
- log what students do and *analyse*
- check and suggest hints
- (at Macalester College teaches trig with R)

# Fast package development (Hester)

- `devtools`, `usethis` for quick package development
- doesn't have to go on CRAN
- given how fast development can be, why not?
- [Jim's demo](https://github.com/jimhester/presentations/tree/master/2018_02_03-You-can-make-a-package-in-20-minutes)
